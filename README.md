The Oxford Parkinson’s Disease Telemonitoring Dataset collected data from many patients using a telemonitoring device to record speech signals. The original study used a range of linear and nonlinear regression methods to predict the clinician’s Parkinson’s disease symptom score on the UPDRS scale. This work compares several machine learning algorithms to determine which is the best model for predicting a disease symptom score on the UPDRS scale. Results showed that of all the machine learning methods Extra Trees Regressor was determined as best. MAE was the preferred performance metric for the research. When compared to other models it was 1.0590. It also had the lowest MSE and RMSE of the models with a 3.2172 and 1.7832. After tuning the mean MAE became 3.5208.
